About the challenge

In this challenge, you will develop an application that uses the GitHub API to fetch issues from a repository, data from your profile, and display them as a blog.

- [x] Display your profile information, including image, number of followers, name, and other available information from the GitHub API.
- [x] List and filter all issues from the repository, providing a brief summary of their content.
- [x] Create a page to display a complete post (issue).

Although there are few features, you will need to revisit concepts such as:

- Fetch / Axios
- Routing and React Router DOM
- Forms

To complete this challenge, you will need to make some preparations and mainly conduct research to understand the GitHub API.
